## Welcome to Ghalib's github pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ghaliba3/ghalib.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

I will make an arduous attempt on sharing my ansible & terraform tutorials for my online students on this account.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ghaliba3/ghalib.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Please let me know if you are looking for a particular course and missing its content. I am available on [headofplatform@googlemail.com]
